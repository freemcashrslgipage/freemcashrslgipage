Cash advance apps like EarnIn, Dave and Brigit let you borrow a small amount from your next paycheck before you receive it. This quick fix may help if you need cash in an emergency, but it’s smart to consider cheaper options before you borrow through a cash advance app.

Unlike with other borrowing options such as credit cards or personal loans, the cost of borrowing through a cash advance app isn't expressed as an interest rate. Instead, the apps may charge subscription or fast-funding fees, and many suggest you tip them.

Lenders and credit card issuers describe the cost of using their products as an annual percentage rate, which accounts for interest and other fees they may charge. Loan app companies argue that APR isn’t a fair way to represent the cost of their products, but we’ve included an example of what the equivalent APR would be for each app based on the fees charged for a sample loan amount.

Here are eight apps that let you borrow against future earnings and some less expensive options to consider.
